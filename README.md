## üéØ Features

This extension adds a popup to your browser that lets you filter for the *exact* kind of problem you want to practice:

* **By Topic:** (e.g., Array, String, Hash Table, Graph)
* **By Difficulty:** (Easy, Medium, Hard)
* **By Solved Status:** (Not Solved, Solved/Accepted, Attempted)
* **By Premium Status:** (All Problems, Free Only, Premium Only)

Click "Generate Problem," and the extension will instantly open a new tab with a random problem that matches all your filters.

If no problems match your criteria (e.g., "Hard" + "Solved" + "Array" and you haven't solved any), it will show you a "No problems found" message.

## üõ†Ô∏è How It Works

This extension doesn't scrape the LeetCode website. Instead, it uses LeetCode's internal **GraphQL API**‚Äîthe same one the official website uses.

1.  It reads your preferences from the popup.
2.  It makes a query to the API to find the **total number** of problems that match your filters.
3.  It picks a random number between 0 and that total.
4.  It makes a second query to fetch the *one* problem at that random position.
5.  It opens the problem's URL (`https://leetcode.com/problems/...`) in a new tab.
